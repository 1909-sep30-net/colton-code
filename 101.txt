git

version control - when writing code we have a desire for version control(want different versions and want to manage them)

version control system (VCS) - software that helps manage
	Git, SVN, HG(mercurial), TFS(older microsoft)

What do they do? 
Centralized and Distributed
	Centralized- helps teams of people. makes 1 central repository that has all versions where developers can pull
	"source of truth" - disagreement on state of something. Centralized helps this

	Distributed (DVCS) - everyone is equal. everyone has copy of code and code history
	
git clone - goes to some other repo and downloads to your local repo(folder on your machine)

trainer-code/README.nd/HelloRevature/.git/

1. make change in working directory(name for all non-git)
	git add - move into staging area before commiting
	git reset - move back to working directory
2. index(staging area) - put stuff here before you want to commit.

	git status - tells you what the state of the four areas are
3. local repo
	git push - push to remote repo
	git pull - pull from remote to your working directory and your index
	git log - way to search through commit history
4. remote repo
	git diff - tells you what the difference is from different areas
	git init - creating a brand new repo
commits - a permanent record of a change made to the contents of that repo. in graph
